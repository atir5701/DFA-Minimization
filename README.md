# DFA-Minimization using Myhill Nerode Theorem

This project implements the DFA minimization algorithm, which is used to reduce the number of states in a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) while preserving its behavior. DFA minimization is crucial for simplifying DFA representations and optimizing their performance.

## Theory of Finite Automata

Finite Automata (FA) is the simplest machine to recognize patterns. The finite automata or finite state machine is an abstract machine that has five elements or tuples. It has a set of states and rules for moving from one state to another but it depends upon the applied input symbol. It is an abstract model of a digital computer DFAs, also known as deterministic finite automata, are finite state machines that accept or reject character strings by parsing them through a sequence that is specific to each string. It is said to be "deterministic" when each string, and thus each state sequence, is distinct.
DFAs are different from non-deterministic automata in that the latter can switch between numerous states and be active in several states simultaneously. Minimization of DFA: DFA minimization stands for converting a given DFA to its equivalent DFA with minimum number of states. DFA minimization is also called as Optimization of DFA. 

## Myhill Nerode Theorem 
Steps –
1. Create the pairs of all the states involved in DFA.
2. Mark all the pairs (Qa,Qb) such a that Qa is Final state and Qb is Non-Final State.
3. If there is any unmarked pair (Qa,Qb) such a that δ(Qa,x) and δ(Qb,x) is marked, then mark 
(Qa,Qb). 
Here x is a input symbol. Repeat this step until no more marking can be made.
We have checked for all the unmarked pairs but don’t need to stop here we need to continue this 
process until no more markings can be made.
4. Combine all the unmarked pairs and make them as a single state in the minimized DFA.


## Usage/Examples
Consider the following DFA

Final state and QB is Non-Final State.

• Check for the unmarked pair Q2,Q1 <br>
• Check when x=0 : δ(Q2,0) = Q4 and δ(Q1,0) = Q3, check if the pair Q4,Q3 is marked and no it is not 
marked. <br>
